# SaltStack
> The Salt Prokect is an approach to infrastructure management built on a dynamic communication bus. Salt can be used for data-driven orchestration, remote execution for any infrastructure, configuration management for any app stack, and much more.


## Getting Started
> The backbone of Salt is the remote executing engine, which creates a high-speed, secure and bi-directional communication net for groups of systems. On top of this comminication system, Salt provides an extremely fast, flexible, and easy-to-user configuration management system called Salt States.

* Crash-free
> Gin can catch a panic occurred during a HTTP request and recovert it.

* JSON validation
> Gin can parse and validate the JSON of a request

* Routes grouping
> Organize your routes better. Authorization required vs non required, different API versions...

* Error management
> Gin provides a convenient way to collect all the errors occured during a HTTP request.

* Rendering built-in

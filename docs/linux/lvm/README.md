LVM
===
> Logical Volume Management, Utilizing the device mapper Linux kernel framework


Introduction
------------
> LVM functions by layering abstractions on top of physical storage devices.

  - Physical Volumes:
    > Physical volumes are regular storage devices

  - Volume Groups:
    > LVM combines physical volumes into storage pools known as volume groups.

  - Logical Volumes:
    > A volume group can be sliced up into any number of logical voluems.
    > Logical volumes are functionally equivalent to partitions on a physical disk, but with much more flexibility.

  - Extents:
    > The extents size represents the smallest amount of space that can be allocated by LVM
    - physical extents:
    - logical extents:

Use Case
--------
  - Mark the Physical Devices as Physical Volumes

# The Amazing Redis
> Redis is an in-memory data structure store, used as a database, in-memory cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries and streams.
> Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availablity via Redis Sentinel and automatic parititioning with Redis Cluster. You can run atomic operations on these types, like appending to a string; incrementing the value in a hash; pushing an element to a list; computing set intersection, union and difference; or getting the member with highest ranking in a sorted set. Redis also supports
> trivial-to-setup master-slave asynchronous replication, with very fast non-blocking first synchronization, auto-reconnection with partial resynchronization on net split. Other features include: Transactions, Pub/Sub, Lua scripting, Keys with a limited time-to-live, LRU eviction of keys.

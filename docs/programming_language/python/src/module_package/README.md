* The Module Search Path
```
# to ensure your module is found, you need to do one of the following:
  1. put mod.py in the directory where the input script is located or the current directory, if interactive
  2. Modify the PYTHONPATH environment variable to contain the directory where mod.py is located before starting the interpreter.

  mod.__file__: determine the location where it was found with the module's __file__ attributes


```
